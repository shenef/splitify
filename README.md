# splitify

Simplifies making splits by generating the split file from a comma and/or newline separated list (yes, mixing newlines and commas works).  
Not sure about its limitations, I've tested it up to 2000 splits and the website and LiveSplit worked fine. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Feel free to make suggestions and submit PRs.
